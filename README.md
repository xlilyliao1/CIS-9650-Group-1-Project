# Wine Quality Project
Physiochemical Properties and Quality of Wine

**Objective:**
We are trying to determine which physicochemical properties of wine have the most impact on quality. The physiochemical properties in our data set are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.


**Files:**
For this project we will use two datasets which total 6499 records, which represent a wine and their properties and their qualities. They are saved in Github but can calso be found using the links below.

-winequality-white.csv 
-winequality-red.csv  

Wine Quality – Red: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv 

Wine Quality – White: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv 

Preview of datasets above: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality 

**Tools used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, statsmodels


**Instructions**
Please perform the following tasks in Python.

1. Open and read the csv files using pandas. 
2. Display how many records are in each of the files.
3. The data did not need any cleaning because it did not contain any invalid fields/data.
4. Import the libraries.
5. Exploratory analysis
6. Regression Analysis
7. Box plots
8. Histograms were used to understand where the wine qualities were concentrated. We used __ to plot our histograms with quality.
9. Independent variables are columns (physiochemical properties). dependent is quality
10.


**Exploratory Analysis:**

**Linear Regression Analysis:**

**Findings:**
The graph shows the most of the wine quality concentrates betwene 5 and 6.
High quality wine has high level of alcohol, citric acid, and sulphates; low level of density and pH.
