# Wine Quality Project
Physiochemical Properties and Quality of Wine

**Objective:**
We are trying to determine which physicochemical properties of wine have the most impact on quality. The physiochemical properties in our data set are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.


**Files:**
For this project we will use two datasets which total 6499 records, which represent a wine and their properties and their qualities. 

winequality-white.csv 
winequality-red.csv  

You can also find the files here. 

**Tools used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, statsmodels

**Exploratory Analysis:**


**Instructions**
Please perform the following tasks in Python using the 2 datasets available from the GitHub repo or 

1. Read the CSV files using pandas. 
2. Exploratory analysis
3. Regression Analysis
4. Box plots
5. Histograms were used to understand where the wine qualities were concentrated. We used __ to plot our histograms with quality.
6. Independent variables are columns (physiochemical properties). dependent is quality
7.



**Strategy:**


**Findings:**
Fang - Boxplots
Conclusion: the graph shows the most of the wine quality concentrates betwene 5 and 6.
conclusion: High quality wine has high level of alcohol,
citric acid, and sulphates;
low level of density and pH.
